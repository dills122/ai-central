# Agent contributor guide

This repository is building a security boundary, not only a developer tool. Treat
changes to execution, policy, artifacts, networking, and dependency handling as
security-sensitive.

## Start here

Read these documents before changing behavior:

1. `docs/PROJECT.md`
2. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
3. `docs/TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md`
4. `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`
5. `docs/FEASIBILITY_SPIKES.md` for pre-freeze or platform work
6. the relevant ADRs in `docs/adr/`

The JSON Schemas in `schemas/` are canonical for the current scaffold but are
explicitly pre-freeze. Do not extend their mixed `Job` authority model as a
shortcut. Follow `docs/protocol/OBJECT_MODEL.md` and the feasibility gates before
replacing them; keep current examples, TypeScript types, behavior, and schemas
consistent until that coordinated replacement.

## AI Central context

AI Central steering and reviewed skills are linked locally into `.codex/` and
ignored by Git. This file remains authoritative for Capsule-specific security
requirements. Generic steering or skill guidance must not weaken the
deny-by-default boundary, expand task scope, or override the verification
requirements below.

See `.codex/AI_CENTRAL.md` for the installed revision, selection, provenance,
licenses, and refresh workflow.

## Working rules

- Preserve deny-by-default capabilities.
- Only the Execution Supervisor may authorize and own creation, termination,
  destruction, or reconciliation of a hostile guest. A narrowly enrolled helper
  may perform a required platform operation only from a sealed Supervisor
  descriptor. Do not add a daemon-to-backend or daemon-to-helper path.
- Execute by Supervisor-issued registration ID only. Never accept replacement
  plan bytes, backend flags, images, mounts, or guest paths at execute time.
- The daemon must not possess Approval, installation-root, or Supervisor evidence
  private keys; issue user-content authority; retrieve user-only content; reset
  grants; or clear quarantine, repair, or trust-epoch state.
- The Approval Broker renders Supervisor-registered typed plan data, not
  daemon-supplied display text, and approval remains one-use and attempt-bound.
- Treat device identifiers as identifiers, not trust. Trust comes from explicit
  local key authorization, purpose binding, installation identity, and trust
  epoch. DIDs never grant authority.
- Do not add live network DID resolution, arbitrary DID methods/resolvers, remote
  JSON-LD contexts, or full TUF/network parsing to approval or execution paths.
- Do not treat an in-process JavaScript sandbox as the host security boundary.
- Do not add unrestricted filesystem, network, process, environment, or artifact
  access to make an example easier.
- Do not pass live host paths into a guest. File inputs must become immutable,
  content-addressed snapshots before execution.
- Do not silently clamp user-owned resource limits. Resolve defaults before
  approval, reject limits above the user ceiling, and enforce the approved
  values exactly or refuse the job.
- Keep runtime adapters separate from the isolation backend.
- Keep rich document, archive, spreadsheet, PDF, image, media, and preview parsing
  out of the daemon and Execution Supervisor. Use bounded Broker validators or a
  future disposable parser sandbox.
- Treat spike code as non-production. Product packages must not import it; retain
  reproducible fixtures/evidence and record the resulting decision before reuse.
- Do not add a new Supervisor responsibility or privileged helper without an ADR.
- Record consequential architecture decisions in an ADR.
- Never claim a backend, profile, control, integrity mode, or security tier is
  implemented, validated, secure, continuous, attested, or production-ready unless
  its exact mechanism and retained adversarial evidence support that claim.

## Verification

Run before handing off a change:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm check
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm verify:schemas
go test ./...
go vet ./...
go build ./...
```

Use Node.js 22 or newer, pnpm 10, and Go 1.23 or newer for the current scaffold.
Runtime and toolchain pins are provisional until the first implementation ADR
locks them down.
